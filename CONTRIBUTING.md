# Contributing to Py-Maker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `Py-Maker`! We welcome
all contributions, big or small.

If you are not sure where to start, please take a look at the [open
issues](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/issues). If you have an
idea for a new feature or would like to report a bug, please open a new issue.
You can also check the **TODO List** for ideas.

I also welcome contributions to the documentation. If you find any errors or
would like to suggest improvements, please open a new issue or submit a Pull
Request.

I you would like to contribute to the code, but find the requirements below a
bit daunting, please feel free to open a discussion and I can help you get
started, or even pair on a PR.

## Prerequisites

Since this is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) project, you will need to
have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of
Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or using
your Operating system's package manager. This project requires **Python 3.9** or
higher.

I'd recommend using
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python installations, the
[pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) works for Linux and
Mac OS X. For Windows, you can use the
[pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) port. See
[here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation ) for installation
instructions.

From version `0.13.0` and forward, we use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to
manage our dependencies (previously we used `Poetry`), so you should have this
installed as well. You can install `uv` by following the instructions on the [uv
website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please make sure you have read and understood our
[Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and
[License](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [next section](#install-dependencies)).
3. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`.
4. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`.
5. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin my-new-feature`.
6. Create a new pull request.

## Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```console
$ uv sync
```

You then need to activate the virtual environment:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

From here you can start working on the project. If you are using an IDE such as
VSCode or PyCharm, you can set the use their Python interpreter setting to use
the virtual environment that has just been created.

### Using Pip

If you prefer to use `pip` instead of `uv`, you can install the dependencies
using the auto-generated `requirements-dev.txt` file:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

However, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/){:target="_blank"} is the recommended
(and only supported) way of developing this project and is tightly integrated
with the code and tools.

## Linting

I am quite strict about linting and code formatting and have set up a number of
pre-commit hooks and tasks to ensure that the code meets the required standards.

Use the `poe ruff`, `poe format` and `poe mypy` tasks regularly. If you use
VSCode, install the `Ruff` and`MyPy` extensions and set them to run on save. The
included `.vscode` folder has the settings for this.

### Install Git Pre-Commit hooks

Please install this if you are intending to contribute to the project. It will
check commits locally before they are pushed up to the Repo. The GitHub CI runs
the linting checks (and MyPy), and will fail if there are any errors.

```console
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will ensure that all code meets the required linting standard before being
committed.

### Run pre-commit manually

You can run these checks manually on all staged files using the below command :

```console
poe pre
```

## Testing

We are using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing.

At the moment the test framework is set up but we only have about 50% coverage.
We will be adding more tests as we go along - and most definitely welcome any
contributions to this area!

If you add any new features, please add tests for them. This will help us to
ensure that the code is working as expected and will prevent any regressions.
_Currently we are not enforcing this until we have better coverage of the code -
**however if you break any existing tests, the CI will fail.**_

There is a task set up to run tests:

```console
$ poe test
```

And run a watcher to automatically re-run the tests when files change:

```console
$ poe test:watch
```

You can also run the tests manually using the following command:

```console
$ pytest
```

The task is set up so we can automatically add other options in the future.

## Changelog

The changelog is automatically generated, using this project, so please do not
edit it manually.

For maintainers, there is a POE task that will run this and update the changelog
file.

```console
$ poe changelog
```

You would also need to add a GitHub Personal Access Token to a local config file
as usual. See the section in the
[Documentation](https://changelog.seapagan.net/installation/#setup-a-github-pat)
for information.

**However, you should NOT include a change to the `CHANGELOG.md` file in any
Pull Requests. This will be handled by the maintainers when a new release is
made**. Your GitHub username will be added to the changelog automatically beside
your PR.

## Convenience Tasks

There are a few other convenience tasks that can be run using the `poe` command.
These are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

Each of these tasks can have extra options added which will be passed to the
underlying tool.

Run **`mypy`** on the code base in strict mode:

```console
$ poe mypy
```

Format the code using **`ruff format`**:

```console
$ poe format
```

Lint the code using **`ruff`**:

```console
$ poe ruff
```

Check the **Markdown**:

```console
$ poe markdown
```

Run `ruff`, `mypy` and `format` at the same time:

```console
$ poe lint
```

## Documentation Tasks

These are to help with developing and updating the documentation.

- `poe docs:serve` - Serve the MkDocs locally for testing and development
- `poe docs:serve:all` - Same as above, but opens to all interfaces so you can
  view it on other devices on your network
- `poe docs:build` - Build the MkDocs site into the `dist` folder
- `poe docs:publish` - Publish the docs to your GitHub pages. **Note that only
  those with write-access to this repo can do this**.

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to `github-changelog-md`:

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. The
  pre-commit hooks will check for this. We are using the [Ruff
  Formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/).
- Fix any linting errors or warnings. The pre-commit hooks will check for
  this also. [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is installed and set to pretty
  strict settings. Ruff now replaces all the original linters that were
  installed. There is also a Markdown linter.
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is installed and we are using
  type hints. Please try to add type hints to your code. If you see any areas of
  the code that are missing type hints, please feel free to open a PR and add
  them üòÅ!
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Write tests for your code.
- Make sure your code passes all existing and new tests before submitting a pull
  request.
- Document your code using
  [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). This project uses the
  [Google Docstring
  Spec](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#381-docstrings) though
  at this time is a bit slack on listing the Args and Returns. I will be adding
  these in as I go along so feel free to add them in if you are contributing :smile:.
- If you add or change any functionality, please update the documentation
  accordingly.
- Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/issues) to report
  bugs or suggest new features.

If you are using VSCode, there is a config file in the `.vscode` folder that
will help you to follow these guidelines. You may need to install some
extensions to get the most out of it. I'll add a list of recommended extensions
here soon. The `Python`, `MyPy` and  `Ruff` ones are very helpful (the included
`.vscode` folder helps configure these).
