## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this code, [please open an
Issue](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/issues) and report it. It may be
already known to us and we may be working on a fix. If not, we will work with
you to understand the issue and fix it. Generally we would annouce any known
vulnerability in the
[Discussions](https://github.com/seapagan/py-maker/discussions) forum.

We use **Dependabot** for security updates and dependency management. If a
security vulnerability is found in a dependency, Dependabot will issue a PR to
fix this as soon as an updated version of the dependency is available. We will
merge these PRs as soon as they are available.
