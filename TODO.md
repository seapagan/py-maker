# TODO List

- Add testing with [Pytest](https://pytest.org)
- Add option to generate a skeleton MkDocs website for the new project
- Ask for more settings ie homepage, repo, etc. and add them to the generated
  `pyproject.toml` file (if the new project is likely to be uploaded to PyPI)
- check manually entered package name to ensure no dashes.
- add a flag to overwrite existing files if the directory exists. Make this
  require confirmation. Alternately allow overwrite with confirmation if an
  existing/populated directory is found. Add a force flag to skip confirmation.
  I think DO NOT allow this when '.' is specified as this could be disastrous.
- when creating a package project, quickly check PyPI to see if the package name
  is already taken. If it is, either abort or ask the user if they want to
  continue (making clear they will need to rename the package before it can be
  uploaded).
- option to dump the default template files to a local directory so they can be
  edited and used as custom templates, optionally dumping to the
  `~/.pymaker/templates` folder overwriting existing customizations.
