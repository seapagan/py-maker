# Quick Start

## Create a new project

To create a new project, run the following command:

```console
$ pymaker new <project-folder>
```

This will create a new directory with the name you provide.

You can create a new project in the current directory by using `.` as the
project folder name. This must be an empty directory:

```console
$ mkdir test-project
$ cd test-project
$ pymaker new .
```

The App will then run the steps needed to get you started quickly:

1. Copy the template files into the new directory
2. Initialise a git repository
3. Commit the boilerplate to Git

You will be asked a series of questions to customise the new project.

## Choose a package name and description

When it asks "Package Name?" you can choose two variants :

1. **If you are creating a standard Python package** that can optionally be
   uploaded to **PyPI**, enter a package name here. Note that underscores ("_")
   must be used as opposed to dashes ("-") to comply with Python package naming
   rules. Default is the project folder name with underscores replacing dashes.
2. **For a stand-alone tool** that will not ne uploaded to PyPI, or is not a
   library, enter '-' for the package name. In this case the `main.py` will just
   be placed in the project root and no package folder will be created or
   referenced.

## Start developing

You should now change into the new directory, install dependencies and activate
the virtual environment:

```console
$ cd <project-folder>
$ poetry install
$ poetry shell
```

Now, you can start developing :smile:

## Example run

```console
$ pymaker new test-project
PyMaker - Generate a Python project skeleton.

Creating a New Python app with the below settings :

    Description : An amazing Bigly test project. better than you've ever seen before!
   Package Name : test_project
         Author : Orange Tango
          Email : bigly@spraytan.org
        License : MIT
    Project Dir : /home/bathroom/test-project
           Name : Test Project

Is this correct? [y/n] (y): y

--> Creating project folder ... Done
--> Creating Git repository ... Done

--> Project created successfully.

Next steps:

    1) Change to the project directory:
    2) Install the dependencies (creates a virtual environment):
        'poetry install'
    3) Activate the virtual environment:
        'poetry shell'
    4) Run the application:
        'test-project'
    5) Code!
